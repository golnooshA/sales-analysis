## 1. Background Overview

This project analyzes the **Superstore Dataset** ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)), which contains order-level information such as sales, profit, category, region, and customer details.

The main objectives are to uncover:

* What are the sales trends across years?
* Which categories and regions contribute the most?
* Where are the growth opportunities?
* How can profitability be improved?

**Workflow:**

* **SQL** → inspection, cleaning, and business queries (`all_queries.sql`, results in `/queries_results/`)
* **Excel** → pivot tables & charts (`/excel/superstore_analysis.xlsx`)
* **Power BI** → interactive dashboard (`/powerbi/superstore_dashboard.pbix`)

## 5. Recommendations

* 📈 **Expand Technology Product Lines:** Since Technology generates the highest revenue share, introducing complementary items (e.g., accessories, bundles) could boost sales further.
* 🎯 **Boost South Region Sales:** Consider targeted discounts, localized promotions, or distribution improvements to raise performance.
* 🗓️ **Leverage Q4 Peaks:** Run holiday promotions and loyalty campaigns before Q4 to maximize already strong seasonal sales.
* 💡 **Diversify Product Mix:** Reduce over-reliance on Technology by strengthening Furniture and Office Supplies offerings.
* 💰 **Optimize Discounts:** Monitor discount strategies, especially in Furniture, to protect profitability margins.
* 🤝 **Customer Retention Programs:** Introduce loyalty incentives for repeat buyers to stabilize long-term sales.
