## 5. Recommendations

* **Expand Technology Product Lines:** Since Technology generates the highest revenue share, introducing complementary items (e.g., accessories, bundles) could boost sales further.
* **Boost South Region Sales:** Consider targeted discounts, localized promotions, or distribution improvements to raise performance.
* **Leverage Q4 Peaks:** Run holiday promotions and loyalty campaigns before Q4 to maximize already strong seasonal sales.
* **Diversify Product Mix:** Reduce over-reliance on Technology by strengthening Furniture and Office Supplies offerings.
* **Optimize Discounts:** Monitor discount strategies, especially in Furniture, to protect profitability margins.
* **Customer Retention Programs:** Introduce loyalty incentives for repeat buyers to stabilize long-term sales.
